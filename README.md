Common python tools and utilities.

## Package Requirements
Download python 3.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) or higher and install to path. 
The following python packages are required: control, numpy, pip, and scipy. I recommend using pycharm IDE, as it simplifies package install, and code debugging.
